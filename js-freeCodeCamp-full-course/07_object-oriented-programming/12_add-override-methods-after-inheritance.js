/* Add Methods After Inheritance

A constructor function that inherits its prototype object from a supertype constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods.

For example, Bird is a constructor that inherits its prototype from Animal:*/

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function () {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
};
function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;

// In addition to what is inherited from Animal, you want to add behavior that is unique to Bird objects. Here, Bird will get a fly() function. Functions are added to Bird's prototype the same way as any constructor function:

Bird.prototype.fly = function () {
    console.log("I'm flying!");
};

// Now instances of Bird will have both eat() and fly() methods:

let duck = new Bird();
duck.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"
duck.fly(); // prints "I'm flying!"


// ----------------------------------

// Exercise: Add all necessary code so the Dog object inherits from Animal and the Dog's prototype constructor is set to Dog. Then add a bark() method to the Dog object so that beagle can both eat() and bark(). The bark() method should print "Woof!" to the console.*/

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function () { console.log("nom nom nom"); };

function Dog() { }

// Only change code below this line
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
    console.log("Woof!");
};

// Only change code above this line

let beagle = new Dog();

// =======================================

/* Override Inherited Methods

In previous lessons, you learned that an object can inherit its behavior (methods) from another object by referencing its prototype object:*/

ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);

// Then the ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype:

ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function () {};

// It's possible to override an inherited method. It's done the same way - by adding a method to ChildObject.prototype using the same method name as the one to override. Here's an example of Bird overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal:

function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function () {
    return "nom nom nom";
};
function Bird() { }

// Inherit all methods from Animal
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Bird.eat() overrides Animal.eat()
Bird.prototype.eat = function () {
    return "peck peck peck";
};

/* If you have an instance let duck = new Bird(); and you call duck.eat(), this is how JavaScript looks for the method on duckâ€™s prototype chain:

duck => Is eat() defined here? No.
Bird => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.
Animal => eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.
Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.

---------------------------------

Exercise: Override the fly() method for Penguin so that it returns "Alas, this is a flightless bird."*/

function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype.fly = function () { return "I am flying!"; };

function Penguin() { }
Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;

// Only change code below this line
Penguin.prototype.fly = function () {
    return "Alas, this is a flightless bird.";
}
// Only change code above this line

let penguin = new Penguin();
console.log(penguin.fly());
