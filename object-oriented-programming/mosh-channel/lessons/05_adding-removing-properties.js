- because we dont have classes we dont need to predefine this properties, we can add them when we need them.*/

//- Another use case for using bracket notation is when youÂ´re using the property names that are not valid identifiers

/*- We can also delete object properties when, for example, when we dont want to sent some user properties to a client (pass, credit card info)
- we use the delete operator */
